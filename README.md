## Overview

In this project I demonstrate simple CRUD operations on a RESTful MERN application.

### Front-End
The frontend is a React application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Dependencies include: Bootstrap 4.3.1, Axios 0.19.0, React-router-dom 5.1.2.

### Backend
The backend is done using Node.js / Express.js and dependencies include: body-parser 1.19.0, cors 2.8.5, express 4.17.1, mongodb 3.3.4, mongoose 5.7.12.

### API Testing
I used [Postman](https://getpostman.com) for API testing.

### Authentication
For the purpose of maintaining simplicity, API authentication has not been done.
